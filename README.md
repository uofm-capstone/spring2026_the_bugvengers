# Tool-Assisted Grading (TAG)
TAG is a web-based application designed to assist professors and teaching assistants in evaluating and grading students. With this application, you can manage grading student an client survey survey's served by Qualtrics (and more features to come).

# Google Cloud Link
https://fall2025-checkmate-1021386482677.us-south1.run.app/semesters

This application is built on Ruby on Rails web framework.

## Prerequisites
* Docker - latest version
Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine. You can get the latest version here: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

## Running the App Locally (Recommended via Docker)
This application is fully containerized and configured for local development using Docker. The primary way to run and develop the app is via `docker-compose`, which builds the backend service and connects it to a PostgreSQL database container.

### Getting Started with Docker

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine**  
   The application must be downloaded locally in order to function correctly in development mode.

2. **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed**  
   Visit [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you haven’t already set up Docker.

3. **Run the app**  
   Use the following command from the project root:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
The application depends on the docker-compose.yml file to manage services and volumes. The PostgreSQL database and Rails server are both defined in this file and will not run correctly outside the containerized environment.

For detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting tips, refer to [CONTAINER_DEVELOPMENT.md](./CONTAINER_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## ☁️ Google Cloud Deployment

This application is deployed on **Google Cloud Run** using a fully containerized setup. The deployment architecture includes:

- **Cloud Run** for running the Dockerized web app
- **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)** for the production database
- **Artifact Registry** for storing Docker container images

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Build and Push Container Image**
   - The app is containerized via the `Dockerfile` in the project root.
   - Images are built locally or via CI and pushed to **Artifact Registry**.

2. **Deploy to Cloud Run**
   - The container is deployed to Cloud Run via the Google Cloud Console or CLI.
   - Environment variables and secrets (e.g., database URL, PAT tokens) are configured in the Cloud Run service settings.

3. **Database Integration**
   - The application connects to **Cloud SQL** via proxy connection.
   - The database must be migrated and seeded manually after first deployment.
   - Tip: If needed, database operations can be set up as Jobs in the cloud console for easy migration during development.

### Notes

- Make sure your GCP project is linked to **Artifact Registry**, and that Cloud SQL and Cloud Run APIs are enabled.
- On app startup, Cloud Run probes port `8080` for health checks—this is preconfigured in the Dockerfile and app server.

## Legacy Manual Setup (Deprecated)
1. Create a workspace folder to download your application.
2. Navigate to your new workspace directory.
3. Clone the repository using the following command: ```git clone git@github.com:mrhosier42/tag.git```
4. Enter the Project Directory: ```cd tag```
5. Install Bundler (if not installed): ```gem install bundler```
6. Install Ruby Gems: ```bundle install```
7. Install JS Dependencies: ```yarn install```
   - If Yarn is not installed:
     - Macos: If you have Homebrew installed: ```brew install yarn```
     - Windows (using WSL w/ Ubuntu): ```npm install --global yarn```
     - Linux: ```npm install --global yarn```
8. Install rails: ```gem install rails```
9. Set Up Database: ```rails db:create```
10. Run Migrations: ```rails db:reset db:migrate```
11. Start rails server: ```rails server``` (or ```rails s``` for short)
12. Access the app: Open ```localhost:3000``` into your browser.

## Navigation to survey's:
1. Sign up with a new account.
2. Create a new semester.
3. Load client and student survey data.
4. Select a sprint and semester.
5. View the page team you want to review.

## Student CSV Format

Each semester requires a student CSV with the following columns:

- Full Name – Student’s full legal name  
- Email – Student’s email (used for communication)  
- Team – Team name for grouping  
- Github Username – Student’s GitHub handle  
- Github Project Board Link – URL to the team’s GitHub Project board  
- Timesheet Link – URL to the team’s shared timesheet  
- Client Meeting Notes Link – URL to the team’s client meeting notes  

An example CSV is located at: `lib/assets/student_template.csv`


## GitHub Analytics - OctoKit API
This application fetches GitHub commit history on a per-contributor and per-sprint basis, presenting it in an easy-to-digest graphical interface. It's designed to streamline the process of monitoring and analyzing commit activities over specific time periods.
1. #### Obtaining a Personal Access Token (PAT):
   * To utilize the [OctoKit API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js), you first need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT). This application can use a [classic token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Please follow the instructions on GitHub to generate your token.

2. #### Configuring the Application:
   * Locate the octokit.js file in your application directory. Replace the placeholder in the file with your newly generated PAT. This setup will allow asynchronous fetching of data.

Note: While there are alternative authentication methods that avoid personal tokens, this implementation currently relies on the PAT system.


## Troubleshooting:
(Linux - Ubuntu)
#### bundle install issue
* If you are seeing this message in your terminal: "An error occurred while installing pg (#.#.#), and Bundler cannot continue.", run the command below:
1. You'll need to install libpq or postgresql client package like so:
   (a) ```sudo apt install libpq-dev```


# History and Progress
This app is a continuation of the development of the previous capstone team and GA's that have worked on this app.
This app was upgraded from an old version of rails framework (6.1) and ruby language (2.7), the reason for the upgrade was to make the app compaitble to run on Mac M1 chips, which were not supported at the time. I've also revamped every single page to make it more modern, removed extra cluttered/unucessary pages and merged those pages functionality into the relevant page for seamless access. I've also fixed countless bugs and overhauled some of the existing features, such as the navbar content (now a dropdown), among other things.

You can find three different versions, if you would like to see the changes made over time. Documentation will also be provided in this repo if you would instead prefer to read version 1 to 3 changes and improvements.
